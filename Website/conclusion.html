		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p>Through the results of our school-wide survey and the data presented to us from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity index, we can clearly infer that the environmental impact of cryptocurrency is a major hazard to the digital future it promises compared to our physical currency which is a mainstay in our daily lives.</p>
		<p> The views of our school-wide survey were in line with our expectations of how people thought of Cryptocurrency, but what truly bewildered us was the fact that through comparing the emissions of Crypto data collected from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Index revealed Bitcoin uses ~113 TWh of energy per year. Without including other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the impact of conventional money is nearly minimal at first glance, but if in the future a society reliant on renewable energies developed it becomes unclear whether one of Bitcoin’s major cons could be offset. But on our current path crypto-only serves to cause more harm to the world instead of elevating our society for the better.</p>
		<p>Nonetheless, the CO2 emissions produced by bitcoin alone is several orders of magnitude higher than the estimated CO2 emissions produced by fiat currency in today’s society.</p>
