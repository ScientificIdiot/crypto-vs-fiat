		<h1>Cryptocurrency and fiat (conventional) currency</h1>
		<h4>Jake (sha0059), Johan (jos0024), Max (whe0005), Hayden (sul0002)</h4>
		<p>Currency has been a staple of human civilisations since ancient times, and the idea of conventional currency, was not challenged for thousands of years. But in the modern age of technology, the notion of digital currency gained massive interest as a possible replacement for the physical notes and coins we exchange on a daily basis. </p>
		<p>Cryptocurrency (commonly shortened to Crypto) is digital money that functions as a means of an exchange over a computer network and is not supported or maintained by any central authority, such as a government or bank. While conventional currency, often referred to as money, is any object that is widely recognised in a certain country or socioeconomic setting as payment for goods and services.</p>
